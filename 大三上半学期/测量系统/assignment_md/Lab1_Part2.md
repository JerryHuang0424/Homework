## Lab content
With the potentiometer set to 0.5%, run an AC Sweep simulation produce a graph of the circuit’s response and determine the cut-off frequency
Repeat the AC Sweep with the potentiometer set to 100% and determine the cut-off frequency, and hence the full adjustable frequency range of the circuit.

## Theory
the cut-off frequency fc is defined the point at which the output voltage is equal to -3 dB (or 70%) of the input voltage, where:
$$
f_c = \frac{1}{2\pi RC}
$$
