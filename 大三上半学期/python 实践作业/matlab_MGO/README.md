# Mountain-Gazelle-Optimizer-MGO
The Mountain Gazelle Optimizer (MGO), a novel meta-heuristic algorithm inspired by the social life and hierarchy of wild mountain gazelles, is suggested in this paper. In this algorithm, gazelles’ hierarchical and social life 
is formulated mathematically and used to develop an optimization algorithm. The MGO algorithm is evaluated 
and tested using Fifty-two standard benchmark functions and seven different engineering problems. It is 
compared with nine other powerful meta-heuristic algorithms to validate the result. The significant differences 
between the comparative algorithms are demonstrated using Wilcoxon’s rank-sum and Friedman’s tests. 
Numerous experiments have shown that the MGO performs better than the comparable algorithms on utmost 
benchmark functions. In addition, according to the tests performed, the MGO maintains its search capabilities 
and shows good performance even when increasing the dimensions of optimization problems.
